                    <h2>Brief History</h2>
                    <P>The Kakamega Friends meeting started sometime in the late 60’s. 
                        Those who were working in the government offices and had come from various places had no place to fellowship therefore had to fellowship in other churches especially in the Anglican Church of Kenya (A.C.K) 
                        When they found out that they were a reasonable number, they started meeting in each other’s homes.
                        When the number increased, those who were working in the county council offices asked for space in a nursery school nearby which was given to various groups at different times.
                        They confirmed to worship there as the numbers increased. 
                        They then went to apply for a plot from the county council and it is the plot on which the church currently sits on that was given.
                        The next step was the plan to build the church in which members gave priority. They started giving towards the construction of the church through material and money form.
                        They even sought assistance from the rest of the friends family in Kenya.
                        The construction was finished and the church was officially opened in the year 1981.
                        Most of the members started fellowshipping in this church and it gave birth to other meetings around Kakamega town.
                        It was given the Monthly Meeting status with other far away Village Meeting forming the lower meetings.

We encourage all friends (Quakers) world wide to strengthen unity and embrace peace as we purpose to serve God. During His sermon on the mountain in Matthew 5:9, Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of God." And in  John 14:27 He said "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you....." So friends, let us stay peaceful. <br><b>Rhoda Sakwa Presiding Clerk.</b><br></p>
